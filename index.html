		Summoners War: Sky Arena, is a mobile turn-based strategy massively multiplayer online game created by South Korean game developer, Com2uS.
		The game was announced and released at the Electronic Entertainment Expo on June 12, 2014 for iOS and Android devices. Summoners War has performed successfully,
		with over 90 million downloads worldwide, and $1.35 billion in earnings.
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
		Players assume the role of a summoner, opening scrolls in order to acquire monsters to fight in turn-based battle.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Monsters</h3>
	
	<p class="p2">
		Newly summoned monsters can range from a 1-star grade to a 5-star grade, with 4 and 5 star monsters being the rarest.
	</p>	
		<ol>
			<li>5 star monsters have about a 0.5% chance to obtain from a mystical scroll.</li>
			<li>4 star monsters have about an 8.2% chance to obtain from a mystical scroll.</li>
			<li>3 star monsters have about a 91% chance to summon from a mystical scroll.</li>
		</ol>
	<p class ="p2">
		Using monsters in battle raises their experience level, and they can be evolved to a higher star grade, with the maximum being a 6-star grade.

		Cairos Dungeon is a critical element in the game. It is where players farm the majority of their runes, all awakening essences, and a variety of other materials.
		These dungeons range in difficulty from B1 being the easiest, to B10 as the most challenging.

		Monsters come in five elements: water, fire, wind, light, and dark. In terms of attack, water monsters have an advantage over fire, fire has an advantage over wind, and wind has an advantage over water.
		Light and dark have advantage over each other, but deal regular damage to the other three types. In addition, each monster also has a specific class, such as support, defense, health points, and attack.[3]

		In addition to evolving to a higher star grade, another gameplay mechanic is awakening', which transforms the monster.
		The process requires "essences" of the element of the monster: fire, water, etc. Monsters that are naturally higher stars, or summoned at higher grade, require more essences.
		Awakening a monster changes its appearance and name, boosts its innate stats, and may allow it to gain a new skill.
